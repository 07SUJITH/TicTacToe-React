 **React State Variable**

In React, state variables are used to manage the dynamic data of a component. They allow components to track and update their internal state, which can then be used to render the component's UI.

To create a state variable, you can use the `useState` hook. This hook takes an initial value as its argument and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state value.

For example, the following code creates a state variable called `count` and initializes it to 0:

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The `count` state variable is then used to render the current count in the UI. When the user clicks the "Increment" button, the `setCount` function is called, which updates the `count` state variable to its previous value plus 1. This causes the component to re-render, and the updated count is displayed in the UI.

**Step-by-step explanation of the code:**

1. We import the `useState` hook from the `react` library. This hook allows us to create state variables in React.
2. We define a functional component called `MyComponent`. This component will use the state variable to track the count.
3. Inside the `MyComponent` component, we call the `useState` hook and pass it an initial value of 0. This creates a state variable called `count` and initializes it to 0.
4. The `useState` hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value (`count`) and a function to update the state value (`setCount`).
5. We use the `count` state variable to render the current count in the UI.
6. We define a button that calls the `setCount` function when clicked. This function updates the `count` state variable to its previous value plus 1.
7. When the user clicks the "Increment" button, the `setCount` function is called, which updates the `count` state variable to its previous value plus 1. This causes the component to re-render.
