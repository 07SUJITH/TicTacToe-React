 ### React Toastify

React Toastify is a React component that allows you to add toast notifications to your application. Toast notifications are small, unobtrusive messages that appear on the screen for a short period of time. They are often used to display success messages, error messages, or other important information.

To use React Toastify, you first need to install it from npm:

```bash
npm install react-toastify
```

Once you have installed React Toastify, you can import it into your React component:

```javascript
import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify';
```

The `ToastContainer` component is responsible for displaying the toast notifications. You need to add it to your component's render method:

```javascript
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ToastContainer />
      ...
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `toast` function is used to display a toast notification. You can pass a message to the `toast` function, and it will display the message in a toast notification. For example:

```javascript
toast('Hello, world!');
```

This will display the message "Hello, world!" in a toast notification.

You can also pass options to the `toast` function to customize the appearance of the toast notification. For example, you can specify the position of the toast notification, the duration of the toast notification, and the style of the toast notification.

Here is an example of how to use the `toast` function with options:

```javascript
toast('Hello, world!', {
  position: 'top-right',
  autoClose: 5000,
  hideProgressBar: false,
  closeOnClick: true,
  draggable: true,
  pauseOnHover: true,
});
```

This will display the message "Hello, world!" in a toast notification that is positioned at the top-right of the screen, has a duration of 5 seconds, and has a progress bar. The toast notification will also be closed when the user clicks on it, and it will be draggable and pause when the user hovers over it.

React Toastify is a powerful component that can be used to add toast notifications to your React application. It is easy to use and customize, and it can be used to display a variety of messages.
