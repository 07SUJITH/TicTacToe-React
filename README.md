 **Project Setup**

This section of the README.md file will provide instructions on how to set up the environment for a React application using Vite. Vite is a build tool that provides a fast and efficient way to develop and build React applications.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm (version 7 or higher)

**Step 1: Create a New Project**

To create a new React application using Vite, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project. Then, run the following command:

```
npx create-vite-app <project-name>
```

This command will create a new directory with the specified project name and install the necessary dependencies.

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**

After creating the project, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

This command will install all the necessary dependencies for the React application, including Vite and other development tools.

**Step 3: Start the Development Server**

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will start the Vite development server, which will automatically compile and serve the React application. The development server will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

**Step 4: Explore the Project Structure**

The Vite project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the React application.
- `public/`: This directory contains static assets such as images, fonts, and stylesheets.
- `node_modules/`: This directory contains the installed dependencies.
- `package.json`: This file contains the project configuration, including the list of dependencies and scripts.

**Step 5: Write Your React Code**

To write your React code, open the `src/App.js` file. This file contains the main component of the React application. You can write your React components and logic in this file.

**Step 6: Build the Application**

To build the React application for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This command will generate an optimized production build of the React application in the `dist/` directory.

**Libraries used**
- react-icons
- react-toastify
